# are-they-anagrams
built-in algorithm to test if given words in a text-file are anagrams. 

the Main class file (Test), invokes a read method to read data from text file, and calls appropriate methods to store data in a 1-D array.
for all the anagrams that exist, they are stored in a modifed ArrayList of an array of modified LinkedList.
the ArrayList is then printed into an output file.
